Architecture

Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
When developing the frontend of my full stack project, Express HTML was used for server-side rendering of HTML. The backend generated views based on the data retrieved from the database. JavaScript was used for dynamic updates by interacting with backend APIs. The SPA provided the user view and experience.

Functionality

How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
JSON is a data-interchange format used for transmitting data between a server and client. JavaScript on the other hand is a programming language used to add interactivity to a web page. JSON allows communication between the fron and back ends by sending data using APIs, and processing it and sending responses back.

Testing

Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
Methods refer to the HTTP used in APIs to describe the type of operation being performed. For instance GET retrieves data, and POST adds data to the server. Endpoints are URLs where the client sends requests to interact with the backend. Securing an API requires protecting it from unauthorized access.

Reflection

How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
This course has prepared me for real-world development. When coding for a job, it will require that I know how to build front and back ends as well as how to integrate them with one another. This has provided hands-on experience and enhanced my knowledge of how to code front and back end programs.
